# File-extractor

The purpose of this python program is to take user input from their home directory.
Extract that path and display what's in the directory and give the user another input for what file extension they would like to enter.
After that, they would again specify a path for where the file extracted would go. 

Program is intended to run until user types "done" or nothing. This program is meant to be for linux, just something I'd like to implement because I'm lazy lol.

No I'm not doing one for windows.
